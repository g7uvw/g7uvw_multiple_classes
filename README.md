# g7uvw_multiple_classes

I needed a simple program to show accessing the member variables and functions in one class from another.
This was about as simple as I could come up with, while still having some baring on the original issue we were tying to solve. I make zero promises for the quality of this code. It's just here to show one way of doing this.

If you spot any glaring errors, please inform me so they can be fixed.
